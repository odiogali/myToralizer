# My Toralizer
### An intro into TCP/IP and more command line stuff but in C this time.

I came across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oBWVVFdI38) by Dr. Jonas Birch and wanted to follow along with his video to see if I could figure out this "simple" (his words) CLI program that reroutes a network command like `curl` or `ping`, sends it to a proxy server which connects to Tor which completes the request, effectively hiding you.
